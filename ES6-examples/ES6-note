- Inside an function a new function with new arrow syntax don't create new scope(this)
- Arrow use same this as surrounding code
- Strict mode rules is bypass this if this is lexical
- this is ignored with arrow function when using call() or apply()
- Arrow function don't bind an argument object
- Arrow function don't bind own this
- Arrow function can not used ad constructor and it' don't have protopye
- Must wrap a parentheses for object return if you are using arrow function

- only have an contructor method in class, not more than
- user the supper keyword to call contructor of parent class
- use static to define a static method for a class. We can call a static method without instantiating and can not call through a class instance
- value of this is undefine if we call a static or prototype without object valued "this"
